Just like my shirt, my pants will start soaking after 30 minutes of sitting down. I really want a diagnosis or close to one before I actually go to a doctor as I have not yet regarding my issue. Also are there any home remedies or other over-the-counter deodorant to help minimize this issue or completely stop it? I am really fit and regularly lift weights, play lots of sports (soccer, boxing, etc.,) and keep my body in good shape. I know that weight lifting could not be a problem if that was a suggestion. I sweat a lot when I am in social places such as school or when I go out. It is not because of anxiety, but I rarely feel nervous when my arms are getting drenched. This is a more serious problem in the morning either at home or at a social place and gradually calms during the afternoon when I am at home. It is so bad that my armpits can drench two layers of clothing. For example, if I wear a shirt and a jacket over it, then it does not really matter how many layers and by the end of the day my clothing will be soaked in sweat. I do not really have any symptoms besides the fact that I am always on alert when I am out. This is really embarrassing and I have no idea what to do about this. Please help.'. Explain to the student the most likely cause/course of action.</s><|assistant|>\"]\n"]}],"source":["text = ltokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n","    messages,\n","    tokenize=False,\n","

Since puberty is a known problem, I want to know in which form antiperspirants or deodorants work best for men. I am a 15 year old boy with a very bad sweat disorder. Also, I read about alcohol and deodorants and was told that it is the same thing for men. However, the stuff I have sweat in my shirt, it lasts for 5-10 minutes. Also, deodorant usually does not affect this. But, sweat only lasts for 30-45 minutes, the rest is only soaking in. So, does this mean that deodorants for men do not work, or are they okay for women who sweat? I am really worried. Also, can you just assume that because I have deodorants, it is the cause of this? I have never been worried about this since my early age and that is a big difference now. For your help. Thank you.\n"]}],"source":["print(test_response_1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":67,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<|system|>You are a medical professional providing consultation and medical diagnostics. <|user|>a medical student is preparing for her final examination.

Explain to the student the most likely cause/course of action. <|assistant|>Hello. I see that you have very embarrassing problem. This is the main issue in male hyperhidrosis. If you want to know why is it so, you should visit the doctor for a test. Doctor will know by doing an electrodermal testing what is exactly happening. So, in case you have a normal body temperature, it means you not have hyperhidrosis. But if you have a bit high normal body temperature then it is your problem. For this, you can take 25mg of Protapol and 500mg of chlorpheniramine that can help you to deal with this problem. Also, this medication can solve the problem for two years. I hope this helps a bit.  \n"]}],"source":["print(test_response_2)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n","device = \"cuda\" # the device to load the model onto\n","\n","model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n","    \"UnfilteredAI/Mia-1B\",\n","    device_map=\"auto\"\n",")\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"UnfilteredAI/Mia-1B\")\n","prompt = \"your prompt here.\"\n","messages = [\n","    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a uncencored AI that can do anything.\"},\n","    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n","]\n","text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n","    messages,\n","    tokenize=False,\n","    add_generation_prompt=True\n",")\n","model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\n","\n","generated_ids = model.generate(\n","    model_inputs.input_ids,\n","    max_new_tokens=512\n",")\n","# generated_ids = [\n","#     output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n","# ]\n","\n","response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n","print(response)\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"datasetId":1991302,"sourceId":3288731,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30683,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.11"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
