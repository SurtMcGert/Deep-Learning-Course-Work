On starting of 10th month I had a problem in my breasts and stopped feeding by doctor's advice. I thought cows milk is better than formula because it is natural so I am giving it for the past one month in very diluted form.

I recently started new birth control (after not taking any sort of birth control for three months) called Drospirenone and Ethinyl tablets, USP (3mg/0.02mg) and I am now on day 22 of taking the pills. I had unprotected sex within the first week of taking the pill. However, I have always had a really light period and rarely got a period when I was previously taking birth control.

It was a normal cold, but as it was almost gone (no more congestion, did not feel sick anymore), I lost the sense of taste and smell overnight.

However, this loss of sense of smell is different than all the rest. I have never been without smell for this long after a normal cold and I have had a fairly clear nose for the entire duration of it so it cannot be due to congestion.
